# Aframe_Project

Our group chose to turn a Google Doodle into a 3D scene. The original 2D image is about the Earth surrounded by the “Google” characters. Regarding the 3D scene construction, we first added depth to the image by placing the Earth in front of the universe and “Google” characters. Then, we turned the Earth (including the coconut tree and chair above it), and the “Google” characters into 3D models, which are all created by us. We also leverage A-Frame's particle system to turn the background shining stars into 3D models.  In addition, we also introduced interactivity and animation to this scene: when hovering over the Earth, the Earth will start spinning; the “Google” characters are rotating and the shining stars are moving as well.
